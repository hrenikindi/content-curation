## 💡 Why I Built This

This project was my entry into a frontend UI hackathon with one mission:

> “Build something **beautiful**, **useful**, and **responsive** — something that feels real.”

Curator is a manifestation of that. From layout to loading states, animations to accessibility, every piece is thoughtfully crafted to provide a seamless user experience.
